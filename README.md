# CrashPad


<br>

## Overview

_**CrashPad** is a community house sharing experience for climbers, and outdoorsy people. The goal is to create a space where you can find a place to crash around the country when visiting crags outside of your local area. Users will have the ability to make an account, and add their home as a CrashPad for others to crash at. Users can search for a crashpad by location, pricing/payment is through virtual currency that is obtained by listing their house as a crashpad, or by purchasing from the site This will prevent price gouging of particular crashpads, and create a trade based isolated economy._

## MVP

> Users will have the ability to make an account, and add their home as a CrashPad for others to crash at. Users can search for a crashpad by location,and contact the host to negotiate nights they will be staying.

### Goals

- _Full auth_
- _Full CRUD_
- _Association between users and listings_
- _Highly styled_

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _The core structure of the front end._ |
|   React Router   | _Allow routing to different screens/pages._ |
| Styled Components | _A good way to style your component within the JSX file._ |
|     Ruby on Rails      | _Backend for RESTful API._ |

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/davidtwhitlatch/414107e2560ae0bb65e233570f2fe056#file-component-tree-png)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.
